The Represent API WordPress plugin allows developers to easily create plugins that harness the Represent API.

== Description ==

[Represent](https://represent.opennorth.ca/) is the largest database of elected officials in Canada, and offers the most comprehensive postal code lookup service for elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government.

The Represent API plugin only provides a mechanism for plugin developers to query the [Represent API](https://represent.opennorth.ca/api/). It is mainly intended as a launch point for developers to create plugins that harness the Represent API.

This module is developed by [Open North](http://opennorth.ca/).
